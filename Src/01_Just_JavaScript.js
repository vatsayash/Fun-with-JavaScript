// console.log() is used to print in Javascript 
// although it's not javascript it's part of the

console.log("Hello JavaScript!");

// javascript is case-sensitive
// that is a varibale something is different from Something

// Identifiers is a sequnce of characters that can be used to identify a variable, a function,an object
// It can start with a letter,the dollar $ sign or an underscore _,and it can contain digits.
// example - test,TEst,test1,_test,$test

// every line is optionally terminated by a semicolons.

// Declaring varibles
const a = 10;
// a = 5;  this is not allowed as javascript does not allows reassiging of the variable

let b = 0;
b = 1;

cannot	be	reassigned.	If	the	variable	points	to	an	object	or	an	array	(we'll	see
more	about	objects	and	arrays	later)	the	content	of	the	object	or	the	array	can
